 The image shows a large stone building with a distinctive Gothic architectural style, including pointed arches and a castle-like appearance. In the background, there is another building of similar architecture, which appears to be part of the same complex. Both buildings feature numerous windows and are constructed from what seems to be light-colored stone blocks. The sky above is partly cloudy, suggesting it might be late afternoon or early evening. There are no visible texts in the image. The style of the photograph suggests it was taken during daylight hours, possibly for real estate or historical documentation purposes.
